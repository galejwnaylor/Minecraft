# What are Water Elevators in Minecraft?

> Water elevators are a means of vertically moving mobs, items, and players.

Elevation changes are a significant feature in Minecraft. Whether game-spawned or player-created, terrain such as mountains, ravines, and mineshafts create challenges for moving items, mobs, and players. While stairways and ladders are viable player options, they are slow and do not transport mobs and items. Water elevators offer a swift and seamless transport system for mobs and items, as well as a fast and fun way for players to move up and down. Adding soul sand at the bottom of the elevator creates a bubble column that moves objects up the elevator. Magma blocks at the bottom of the elevator draw them down. Players can also use keys to move up (Space bar) and down (Shift key) the elevator.

For transporting players and mobs long vertical distances, drowning is a risk. However, water elevators can provide air (using bubble columns) or use alternating blocks of water and air, so breathing is not an issue. Flat items (such as ladders or signs) stop the water from flowing to the block below and keep alternating water blocks in place. Similarly, signs or ladders allow players and mobs to enter the elevator while preventing water from flowing out the bottom.

Other uses of water elevators include item sorting systems that, for example, bring items up from a mine and send them across a series of hoppers to be identified and sorted into different chests.
