# You Survived! Now What?
> After mastering basic survival, what are some things to do next? 

## Notes
- Build a base
- Collect ores, upgrade tools and make armor
- Get food (seeds from grass --> wheat --> bread, breed cows and sheep; apples from oak trees; zombie flesh, but it makes you sick; kill cows, sheep, pigs, chickens and cook the meat (can you eat raw meat?); ???)
- Fight hostile mobs?
