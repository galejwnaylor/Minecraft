# How to Survive Your First Night

> What are the first things you should do to survive in Minecraft?

 

## First Steps (Trees, Shelter, Sheep)
1. **Look around.** When you first spawn in your Minecraft world, you have no tools and no resources: only your fists. You will want quickly to find trees, shelter, and sheep (1) (if possible). Shelter can be a shallow cave or dirt to build with. Stay away from deep caves (or block off the back of the cave) because that's where hostile mobs will spawn and come to attack you. (If you spawn on an island or in the desert, you may need to swim or run to a different area to find trees and animals.) Stay close to your spawn site so when you die and respawn you can pick up your items before they disappear.

2. **Gather wood.** When you find a tree, punch it with your fists until you collect four or five blocks of wood.

3. **Make a crafting table.** Open your crafting menu and turn some of the logs into planks. Use the planks to make a [crafting table](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Table). 

4. **Make a pickaxe and sword.** Use the planks to make sticks, and then make a pickaxe and a sword. Search the crafting table recipes or look them up online. 



## Notes
(1) Sheep are not required to survive the first night, but without them (or quite a bit of spider string) you cannot sleep. That makes surviving the night by hiding in your shelter for 10 minutes very boring. If you don't sleep for several nights in a row, dangerous phantoms will spawn.
