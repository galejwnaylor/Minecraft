# How to Survive Your First Night

> What are the first things you should do to survive in Minecraft?

 

## First Steps ~(Trees, Shelter, Sheep)~
Your goal at the end of the first Minecraft day (which lasts about 10 minutes) is to have a shelter where you can spend the night, ideally with a bed so you can sleep. (If you do not have a bed, you will have to stay awake for the entire 10 minute Minecraft night which is *boring!*) Stretch goals for following days are to  collect wood, cobblestone, and coal so you can makes stone tools and torches.

Many tutorials describe the beginning aspects of the game, and I've listed a few in the Resources section below. In general, you need to do some version of the following steps:

1. **Look around.** When you first spawn in your Minecraft world, you have no tools and no resources: only your fists. You will want quickly to find trees, shelter, and sheep (1) (if possible). Shelter can be a shallow cave or dirt to build with. Stay away from deep caves (or block off the back of the cave) because that's where hostile mobs will spawn and come to attack you. (If you spawn on an island or in the desert, you may need to swim or run to a different area to find trees and animals.) Stay close to your spawn site so when you die and respawn you can pick up your items before they disappear.

2. **Gather wood.** When you find a tree, punch it with your fists until you collect four or five blocks of wood.

3. **Make a crafting table.** Open your crafting menu and turn some of the logs into planks. Use the planks to make a [crafting table](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Table). 

4. **Make tools.** Use the planks to make sticks, and then make a pickaxe and a sword. If you have enough wood, make an axe and a shovel. (An axe makes it easier to gather wood, and a shovel makes it easier to gather dirt. For tool recipes, use the crafting table search functionality or look up recipes online.) Be sure to save at least 3 planks so you can make a bed.

5. **Collect resources.** Use your pickaxe to mine stone. If you can find coal, collect it! Coal lets you build torches and collecting it gives you experience points (XP). Look for stone and ores in ravines and in shallow caves. (Hostile mobs spawn in dark places, so be alert and ready to run!) You can also dig into a hill or mountain. (See TBD hints for how to stay safe when mining.)

6. **Look for sheep, and make a bed.** If you have a good amount of daylight left, search for sheep. Other animals are useful, but you need wool to make a bed. You will need to kill three sheep to get their wool. Use your crafting table to make yourself a bed.

7. 



## Notes
(1) Sheep are not required to survive the first night, but without them (or quite a bit of spider string) you cannot sleep. That makes surviving the night by hiding in your shelter for 10 minutes very boring. If you don't sleep for several nights in a row, dangerous phantoms will spawn.
