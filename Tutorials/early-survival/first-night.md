# How to Survive Your First Night

> What are the first things you should do to survive in Minecraft?

 
## First Steps
When you first spawn in your Minecraft world, you have no tools and no resources: only your fists. You will want quickly to find trees, shelter, and sheep (1). If you spawn on an island or in the desert, you may need to swim or run to a different area (*biome*) to find trees and animals. It's a good idea to stay relitively close to your spawn site because, if you are killed, that's where you will *respawn*. (Quickly get back to the place you were killed, and you may be able to pick up your items before they disappear.)


## First Steps

When you first spawn in your Minecraft world, you have no tools and no resources: only your fists. You will want quickly to find trees, shelter, and sheep (1). If you spawn on an island or in the desert, you may need to swim or run to a different area (*biome*) to find trees and animals. It's a good idea to stay relatively close to your spawn site because, if you are killed, that's where you will *respawn*. (Quickly get back to the place you were killed, and you may be able to pick up your items before they disappear.)

Your goal at the end of your first Minecraft day (which lasts about 10 minutes) is to have a shelter where you can safely spend the night, ideally with a bed. (If you don't have a bed, you'll have to stay awake for the entire 10 minute Minecraft night, which is *boring!*) Stretch goals for the following days are to collect wood, cobblestone, and coal so you can makes stone tools and torches.

Many tutorials describe the beginning aspects of the game, and I've listed a few in the Resources section below. In general, you need to do some version of the following steps:

1. **Gather wood.** When you find a tree, punch it with your fists until you collect four or five blocks of wood.

1. **Make a crafting table.** Open your crafting menu and turn some of the logs into planks. Use the planks to make a [crafting table](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Crafting_Table). 

1. **Make tools.** Use the planks to make sticks, and then make a pickaxe and a sword. If you have enough wood, make an axe and a shovel. (An axe makes it easier to gather wood, and a shovel makes it easier to gather dirt.) For tool recipes, use the crafting table search functionality or look up recipes online. Be sure to save at least 3 planks so you can make a bed.

1. **Collect resources.** Use your pickaxe to mine stone. If you can find coal, collect it! Coal lets you build torches, and collecting it gives you experience points (XP). Look for stone and ores in ravines and in shallow caves. (Hostile mobs spawn in dark places, so be alert and ready to run!) You can also dig into a hill or mountain. (See TBD hints for how to stay safe when mining.)

1. **Look for sheep, and make a bed.** If you have a good amount of daylight left, search for sheep. Other animals are useful, but you need wool to make a bed. You will need to kill three sheep to get their wool. Use your crafting table to make yourself a bed.

1. **Make a shelter.** Your shelter can be a shallow cave or dirt to build with. Stay away from deep caves (or block off the back of the cave) because that is where hostile mobs will spawn and come to attack you.

1. **Get a jump on Day 2.** If you managed to get this far, and you still have some daylight, check out the [Notes](notes-id) for a few things to try before night falls.

1. **Sleep, or wait out the night.** When the sun rises, congratulations! You survived your first night in Minecraft!



## Notes
(1) Sheep are not required to survive the first night, but without them (or quite a bit of spider string) you cannot sleep. That makes surviving the night by hiding in your shelter for 10 minutes very boring. If you don't sleep for several nights in a row, dangerous phantoms will spawn!
